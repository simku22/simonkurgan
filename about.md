Hello! I'm Simon. 

I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Information Technology (Software Development & Human-Computer Interaction), as well as a Jr. SDE at Amazon. 

On this site you can find some of my photos and information about my hobbies. I regularly compose and listen to new music (mostly jazz and classics), and photograph on film (Canon A-1) and with a digital Fuji XT-20. Navigate to the photography tab to see my updated portfolio! [(or just click here)](https://simku22.github.io/refactored-website).

This site will likely not exist soon, but enjoy the relic while its still live :>
