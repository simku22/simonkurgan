This is a Voronoi Stippling artwork, which uses a variant of Lloyd's Algorithm to implement lightness-based points to create shape and figure. This code and sourcework is pulled from Mike Bostock's <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/voronoi-stippling">Observable Article.</a> 

I initially chose a photo with a dark background, and inverted the color scheme to allow the algorithm to properly allocate less "weight" and points to lighter parts of the frame. This methodology works particularly well with black & white images that silhouette a figure.
